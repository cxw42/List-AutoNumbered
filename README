NAME
    List::AutoNumbered - Add line numbers to lists while creating them

    Quick summary of what the module does.

    Perhaps a little code snippet.

        use List::AutoNumbered;

        my $foo = List::AutoNumbered->new();
        ...

GLOBALS
  $TRACE
    (Default falsy) If truthy, print trace output.  Must be accessed directly
    or requested on the "use" line, e.g.:

        use List::AutoNumbered; $List::AutoNumbered::TRACE=1;

    or

        use List::AutoNumbered '*TRACE'; $TRACE=1;

METHODS
  new
    Constructor.  Call as "$class->new($number)".  Each successive element
    will have the next number, unless you say otherwise (e.g., using "LSKIP").

  size
    Returns the size of the array.  Like "scalar @arr".

  last
    Returns the index of the last element in the array.  Like $#array.

  arr
    Returns a reference to the array being built.  Please do not modify this
    array directly until you are done loading it.  List::AutoNumbered may not
    work if you do.

  load
    Push a new record with the next number on the front.  Usage:

        $instance->load(whatever args you want to push);

    Or, if the current record isn't associated with the number immediately
    after the previous record,

        $instance->load(LSKIP $n, args);

    where $n is the number of lines between this "load()" call and the last
    one.

    Returns a coderef that you can call to chain loads.  For example, this
    works:

        $instance->load(...)->(...)(...)(...) ... ;
        # You need an arrow ^^ here, but none after that.

  add
    Add to the array being built, without inserting the number on the front. 
    Does increment the number and (TODO) respect skips, for consistency.

    Returns the instance.

  LSKIP
    A convenience function to create a skipper.  Prototyped as "($)" so you
    can use it conveniently with "load":

        $instance->load(LSKIP 1, whatever args...);

    If you are using line numbers, the parameter to "LSKIP" should be the
    number of lines above the current line and below the last "new" or "load"
    call.  For example:

        my $instance = List::AutoNumbered->new(__LINE__);
        # A line
        # Another one
        $instance->load(LSKIP 2,    # two comment lines between new() and here
                        'some data');

PACKAGES
  List::AutoNumbered::Skipper
    This package represents a skip and is created by "LSKIP".  No
    user-serviceable parts inside.

   new
    Creates a new skipper.  Parameters are for internal use only and are not
    part of the public API.
